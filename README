Building and running Adasim
---------------------------

Building and running Adasim is simple. There are two
basic ways to compile and run Adasim. Either use Ant,
or create an Eclipse workspace and compile through Eclipse.
Below are instructions how to achieve both.

Compiling with Ant
------------------

The ant build file supports the following targets:

compile        compile the adasim core
test-compile   compile the adasim test suite
test           run the adasim test suite
jar            build an executable JAR file containing only the 
               adasim core
jar-deps       build an executable JAR file that includes
               all dependencies and should run without having 
               to set the classpath
javadoc        generate end-user JavaDoc documentation. The
               generated HTML will be in 'javadoc'.
               
The easiest way to compile and run Adasim is to use
ant jar-libs 
to compile and package adasim. Then run
java -jar adasim.jar -I config.xml
where 'config.xml' must be a configuration file.

Compiling with Eclipse
----------------------

The source checkout already contains a project file for
Eclipse. Checking out through the MercurialEclipse 
plugin should set you up.
If it doesn't, import your checkout into your Eclipse 
workspace, add all the JARs in the 'lib' directory
to the classpath, define 'src' and 'test' as source
directories and you are good to go.
