/**
 * TrafficSimulator is the core the simulator. It keeps track
 * of the graph and where all the vehicles are located on it, and outputs information to
 * the logger object with every step taken.
 * <p>
 * Usually there is no need to explicitly create an object of this type. Normal use of
 * the simulator is handled through the commandline interface of {@link TrafficMain}.
 * <p>
 * There are several types of agents and other active elements in a
 * simulation. Currently the simulator enforces the following 
 * protocol in each cycle <em>t</em>:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Vehicles scheduled to start in cycle <em>t</em> are added to the simulation
 * <li>All agents (including vehicles, but not GraphNodes) can perform an action
 * <li>All GraphNodes execute the vehicle movement protocol (documented in {@link GraphNode}).
 * </ol>
