/**
 * 
 * The vehicle object represents a single vehicle on the graph.
 * <p>
 * Vehicles are part of the core classes of Adasim and receive
 * special treatment up to a point. While they also implement the 
 * AdasimAgent interface, the takeSimulationStep() method is empty.
 * <p>
 * Special treatment arises because both TrafficSimulator and 
 * RoadSegment know about Vehicles and implement protocols for communicating 
 * with them. The specifics of these protocols are documented in the 
 * corresponding classes.
 * <p>
 * User implemented agents and strategies should never <strong>set</strong>
 * any properties of vehicles (with the possible exception of updating strategies).
 * Users also must never call protocol methods such as takeSimulationStep() 
 * and move(). Their internals and use are restricted to the core simulator.
